					<h3>Karate Lingo</h3></a>
					<p>In this very first blog, I would like to introduce you to very basic terminology of karate. I would like to clarify one thing before you start reading this, this is for those who really want to know karate and not for those who already consider them good enough or/and are already familiar with this terminology.</p></div>
