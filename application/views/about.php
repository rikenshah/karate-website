						<h4><a href="#">What is Karate?</a></h4>
						<p> Karate can be described as a martial art, or fighting method, involving a variety of techniques, including blocks, strikes, evasions, throws, and joint manipulations. Karate practice is divided into many aspects: For instance, kihon (basics), kata (forms), kumite (sparring), etc. It is a complete exercise involving not only body but also mind.

						<br>
						<br>
						The word karate is a combination of two Japanese characters: kara, meaning empty, and te, meaning hand; thus, karate means "empty hand." Adding the suffix "-do" (pronounced "doe"), meaning "way," i.e., karate-do, implies karate as a total way of life that goes well beyond the self-defense applications. In traditional karate-do, we always keep in mind that the true opponent is oneself.
